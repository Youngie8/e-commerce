          <p><span className="front-qoute">"</span> I diligently saved funds for an entire year with the intent of purchasing aspecific laptop that my daughter had expressed her desire for. Upon arriving the store, I discovered that the price of the laptop has unexpectedly doubled. This revelation brought me considerable distress. I really wished there was a pay in installments store where I can buy laptops. <span className="back-qoute">"</span></p>
